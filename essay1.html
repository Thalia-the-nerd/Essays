    <h1>A Critique of the Capitalist System</h1>
    
    <p>The Capitalist system is built to serve the Capitalist class and the Capitalist class alone. While some believe that you can become rich if you work hard enough due to generational wealth and a set of other factors that you do not control, we do not live in a meritocracy. The richest man in the world has 400 billion dollars, more than the GDP of Denmark, a country of the imperialist core. </p>

    <p>Now, when addressing the imperialist core, we have to acknowledge how the imperialist core is so rich while the global south is left to suffer. The United States was built off of slavery and the exploitation of workers. As Fidel Castro once said: </p>

    <blockquote>“They talk about the failure of socialism but where is the success of capitalism in Africa, Asia and Latin America?” - Fidel Castro</blockquote>

    <p>Around the world, people are left to suffer while the bourgeoisie in the countries of the imperialist core grow richer. Why can the United States, the richest country in all of history, not have a better healthcare system than a third-world country like Cuba, which offers free healthcare? The reason is that it’s more profitable. It’s more profitable for someone to pay for insurance. It’s often more profitable for companies to sell things that people don’t need due to commodity fetishism. </p>

    <p>Generally, at this point, people introduce the idea of Capitalism and Socialism in a mixed economy, but this is a system that will not work. As long as Capitalism exists, people will be exploited. The very concept of wage labor is exploitation. An example of this is how CEO compensation has increased by 940% since 1978, while worker wages have only risen by 12% in the same period. The worker not only works for themselves but also for the bourgeoisie, while the bourgeoisie remains high in their ivory tower, distant from the labor that sustains them. </p>

    <p>Before moving into the conditions needed for a revolution to succeed, we must first touch on one last example of the success of socialism: The USSR. While the USSR was not perfect, it succeeded in turning a feudal economy (comparable to India at that time) into a world superpower that was conquering the cosmos and a direct competitor to the United States. While the USSR failed to invest in light industry, this did allow them to survive and win World War II. </p>

    <p>The USSR's life expectancy under Stalin was 69.3 years compared to 70 in the USA. Housing in the USSR was comparable, if not exceeding, US housing today, especially considering that housing in the USSR never exceeded 5% of income. Furthermore, due to the amount of price restrictions in place, you had more money to spend on what you wanted. </p>

    <p>The time when a revolution can not only occur but succeed is when the bourgeoisie stop giving concessions, or when the workers of the world unite against the one true enemy: the capitalist class. The bourgeoisie want only money and power. We must not settle for concessions, as long as the capitalist system exists it must be destroyed. </p>
